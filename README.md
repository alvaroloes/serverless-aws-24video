# Exercises and examples from book "Serverless Architecture on AWS"
This repository contains the exercises and examples shown in the book "Serverless Architecture on AWS: With examples using AWS Lambda" (Author: Peter Sbarski) written in Go. 
This is a personal initiative and the exercises might have some differences from the code written in the book.

The original exercises written in Node.js are in the authors repository: https://github.com/sbarski/serverless-architectures-aws
